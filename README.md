A bookshelf app I created as a project for my Udacity React Nanodegree.
See: [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

A browser tab will open with the app running.
